Seems really easy.
Just travel outward on the grid once for each direction and count until you hit an obstacle.

1000x1000 max board
10,000 max obs

Store the obstacles in a quick look-up data strut. An array would work fine for the 1k x 1k board but a dict might be better for a sparce larger board
